This is a solution for the project from 
THE ODIN PROJECT LIBRARY https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library

The app should do the following:

1 Display an array of books on the page
2 Have a button to add a new book
3 Each book has a toggle button for read
4 Each book has a button to remove it

Steps:

+ Object Constructor to build objects for books
+ Adding the object books to the array
+ Displaying the books on the HTML page
+ A button to toggle read/unread on each book
+ A button to remove each book
